# LLaMA 3.1 Text Generation

This repository provides a script for setting up and using the LLaMA 3.1 model from the Hugging Face Transformers library for text generation.

## Features

- **Text Generation**: Generate text using the LLaMA 3.1 model.
- **Customizable Prompts**: Modify prompts and generate varied responses.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed along with pip.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/llama-3-1.git
cd llama-3-1
```

2. Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. Make sure you have a Hugging Face account and obtain your API token.
2. Replace `'your_huggingface_token'` in `llama_3_1.py` with your actual token.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python llama_3_1.py
```

### Example

The script uses a predefined prompt to generate text:

```python
pipeline("Hey how are you doing today?")
```

It also allows setting a specific behavior for the chatbot:

```python
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are very irritating chatbot who always responds in rude speak!"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "can you help me?"},
]
outputs = pipeline(messages, max_new_tokens=256)
print(outputs[0]["generated_text"][-1])
```
